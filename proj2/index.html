<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this project, we wrote code to draw curves and surfaces and manipulate meshes.
  We applied different techniques learned in lecture such as de Casteljau's algorithm for computing Bezier curves and area-weighted normals, as well as mesh manipulation techniques.
  This project really helped us better understand how smooth surfaces and curves are computed in graphics, and it solidified the idea of meshes to represent 3d geometries, and the data sturcutres used to implement them.
  We found the representation of triangle meshes very interesting, and we are glad to have gained firsthand experience in how different operations can be implemented using the halfedge representation.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

<p>
  De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive method for evaluating a point (chosen by parameter t) along a Bezier curve parametrized by some points.
  We implemented it by using a series of linear interpolations between each two consecutive points to generate n-1 new points. This is then applied recursively until we narrow down to one point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>

<p>
  To compute a point on a bezier surface, we parametrize by u and v. We take the nxn grid of 3d points and apply de Casteljau on each row with u, then apply it on the resulting points with v.
  We implemented it using 3 helper functions: the first does the same as part 1, the second calls the firat recursively on a 1d array of points, and the 3rd calls the second on each row, then on the final array.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
  
<p>
  We looped through the faces by iteratively getting halfedge->twin->next, which gives us the next adjacent halfedge to the vertex. 
  For each face, we use the vertices to construct two vectors along the edges, and get the cross-product to get the area-weighted normal. 
  We then sum these up and divide by the total area (sums of magnitudes of the cross-products) to get the final result.

</div>


<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
  
<p>
  We first retrieved all of the relevant vertices, faces, and half-edges. Then, we set the half-edge for each vertex and face appropriately, then set the next and vertex of the flipped halfedges, and then the next and face of the other halfedges along the two faces.
  To debug, we tried writing out each of the class members of each modified element and comparing this to a diagram we drew. We also tried changing things like positions of points to verify that we were referencing the correct points.
  In the end, weird pointer/address things were the most difficult for us to debug.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge split</h3>
  
<p>
We implemented the edge split operation by creating the necessary new mesh elements, and then methodically working through the necessary pointer reassignments. We ended up creating a new vertex, two new faces, three new edges, and six new half-edges. We then reassigned nearly all of the pointers, fixing in groups by edges, then halfedges, then faces, then the new vertex.

<p>
Our debugging journey was pretty fun. We decided to work separately on parts 4 and 5 since they were similar ideas, and we ended up both encountering similar problems. Namely, we would often get black triangles or disappearing faces when we tried to apply our edge operations.
After debugging individually, we tried swapping our code and reviewing each others' implementations, and we were able to quickly spot mistakes that the other person was making. I think it was a cool demonstration of how it's easy to get stuck in loops in your own brain that make it difficult to see where your thinking is wrong, but having someone else offer a second perspective can help you see new insights.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision</h3>

<p>
We implemented loop subdivision by mostly following the outline given in the source code. One issue that we had was that we wanted to use the <code>isNew</code> flag to stop the split loop and also detect new edges, but it wasn't possible to do both at the same time. The adjustment we made was adding a flag for edges called <code>isSplit</code> that helped track when edges were called in the first splitting loop. We left the <code>isNew</code> flag to detect the blue edges that were flip candidates.

    <img src="./torus2.png" align="middle" width="600px"/>
    <figcaption align="middle">Torus after two loop subdivisions</figcaption>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
As we can see from the screenshots, as we do more loop subdivisions, sharp corners and edges seem to be smoothed out. The torus begins with very sharp edges in a polygonal shape, but quickly turns into the round shape that we expect.
</p>

<p>
For the cube mesh, we notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetrical after repeated subdivisions. This might be because the faces in the cube are not arranged in a symmetrical way. Below, we show some preprocessing that results in a more symmetric upsampled result.
</p>

    <img src="./cube1.png" align="middle" width="600px"/>
    <figcaption align="middle">Preprocessed cube after loop subdivision</figcaption>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
As we can see in the preprocessed screenshot, the triangles in the cube mesh are in a more symmetric arrangement. That is, there are four corners that meet at the top of a pyramid-like arrangement of triangles, and four other corners that meet at the endpoints of the edge through each face. Both these sets of four corners have the same relative arrangement, just in opposite directions. This results in the symmetrical, rounded-tetrahedron-like shape after loop subdivision.

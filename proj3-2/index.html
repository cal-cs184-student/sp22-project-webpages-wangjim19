<p>
In this project, we implmented structures to model new types of materials. Specifically, we implmented reflective and refractive materials in Part 1, and microfacet materials in Part 2.
Our approach to this project was to follow the various equations presented in class. We found the lecture slides and in-line code comments to be especially helpful in correctly implementing the various mathematical equations for each section.
Some problems we encountered were dark spots or blank areas in our renders. These were helpfully addressed in the project spec, and after double-checking our math we were able to resolve our issues.

<p>
	When max_ray_depth = 0, the only light comes directly from the light source. When max_ray_depth = 1, we now see light reflecting off the walls and the spheres,
	so we can see the walls and the patches of light in the spheres. When max_ray_depth = 2, we can see light bouncing off the walls, hitting the sphere, and reflecting
	off the sphere. This results in the reflection of the room in the spheres. We can also see the light reflecting off the spheres, then bouncing off the ceiling, which
	causes the illumination of the ceiling. When max_ray_depth = 3, we can see refraction effects: light bounces off the wall, gets refracted into the front sphere, gets
	refracted out of the front sphere, and reaches the camera. This allows us to see the walls in the front sphere. We can also see the ceiling in the back sphere, since
	light can get reflected off the sphere, hit the ceiling, then come back to the sphere to get reflected to the camera. We also see light refracting into the front 
	sphere, onto out of the front sphere, then reflecting off the ground to the camera. This creates the bright patch in the shadow. When max_ray_depth = 4, the refracted 
	light from the front sphere can be reflected off the back sphere: light hits the wall, gets refracted into the front sphere, gets refracted out of the front sphere, 
	then gets reflected by the back sphere to the camera. This shows the color of the purple wall in the back sphere. For m=5 and 100, there are no more obvious multi-
	bounce effects except light bouncing back and forth between spheres, walls, and floor/ceiling, so there are no additional obvious visual effects.

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Microfacet Materials</h2>
<p>
In this section, we implemented microfacet materials. To do so, we simply followed the equations and implementation notes outlined in the project spec, and we were able to get the correct results without much issue.
</p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <figcaption align="bottom middle">Scenes rendered with different &alpha; values</figcaption>
                    <td align="middle">

                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="./images/dragon_0.05.png" width="480px" />
                    <figcaption align="bottom middle">&alpha; = 0.05</figcaption>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="./images/dragon_0.25.png" width="480px" />
                    <figcaption align="bottom middle">&alpha; = 0.25</figcaption>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="./images/dragon_0.5.png" width="480px" />
                    <figcaption align="bottom middle">&alpha; = 0.5</figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
<p>
In the figures above, we can see that with lower &alpha;, the material is more glossy, while with higher &alpha;, the material is more diffuse. This is in line with the explanations given in the project spec and in lecture: higher &alpha; values cause the microfacet surface to be more rough and spread out, creating a diffuse macrosurface, while lower &alpha; values cause the microfacet normals to have a more concentrated distribution and the resulting distribution to have a more glossy appearance.
</p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <figcaption align="bottom middle">Scenes rendered with different sampling methods</figcaption>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="./images/bunny_hemisphere.png" width="480px" />
                    <figcaption align="bottom middle">Cosine hemisphere sampling</figcaption>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="./images/bunny_importance.png" width="480px" />
                    <figcaption align="bottom middle">Importance sampling</figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
<p>
In the figures above, we see that cosine hemisphere sampling results in significantly noise in the image, especially on the surface of the microfacet material.
This is because the cosine hemisphere sampling is more suited for diffuse materials, while the actual surface is quite glossy. This causes many of the samples in hemisphere sampling to not detect/reflect any light.
In contrast, the Beckmann model offers a more accurate idea of which regions incoming light would have to come from in order to reflect back off the surface of the material into the camera, so the bright/dark regions are largely correctly lit.

<h2 align="middle">Collaboration</h2>
<p>
For this project, we collaborated by dividing the project into parts. Since we only had to do two parts, and the first two parts of the project were largely separate from each other, we found splitting the work to be very effective for us.
Since we struggled to meet the deadline on the last project, we also made an effort on this project to get started earlier. We started planning earlier for when to start the project and how to divide the work, and we found that we were able to work at a more comfortable pace on this project as a result.

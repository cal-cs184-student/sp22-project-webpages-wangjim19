<p>
In this project, we implemented some basic ray-tracing algorithms for rendering lighting in various scenes. Some parts of this include ray intersection calculations, acceleration data structures and algorithms, and more.
Our approach to implementing the different parts of this project was to follow the slides and algorithms presented in class, while also integrating the syntax and project structure presented in the existing starter code.
Some problems we encoutered were blank or missing components in our render, which were usually caused by missing intersections. We also encountered instances of scenes being too bright or too dim, which often was a result of incorrect constant scaling factors.
As we discovered the different types of errors we could encounter, it became easier to debug later parts of the project, as we had a better idea of where errors in our code were probably arising.

    <h2 align="middle">Collaboration</h2>
<p>
For collaboration, we found that splitting the project up by parts was effective for us. However, this doesn't mean we were working on each part independently.
Rather, since each part of the project typically had some dependency on a different part, we first made sure we understood the big idea of each part. This served a two-fold purpose.
First, when working on the sections individually we had a better idea of what would be/had been implemented in a different part.
Secondly, having an understanding of the other member's task allowed us to do code reviews, lending fresh eyes to each others' code when we found ourselves stuck on a stubborn bug.
On another note, since this project was much larger than previous ones, we had to devise a way to effectively version control, and started using branches for each part, communicating when branches were tested/ready to be merged into the master branch.

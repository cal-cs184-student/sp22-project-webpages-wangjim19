Summary
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
<p>
Low ks
with low ks, the cloth is more loose and droops more. This is likely because the low ks makes it so that the spring correction forces are lower, so the cloth appears less taut.
we also notice more ripples in the final resting state of the cloth, as the pieces hang more loosely
</p>
<p>
High ks
with high ks, the cloth appears much more rigid. Since the spring constant is high, the spring correction forces keep the cloth from deforming as much. As such, throughout the dropping process the cloth is more flat.
</p>
<p>
Density
As density increases, so does the total mass of the cloth. As such, with higher density, the cloth hangs lower at resting position. With lower density, the cloth appears to move as a much lighter sheet and does not hang as low when at rest.
</p>
<p>
Damping
when damping is low, the behavior of the cloth during movement is much more erratic since the spring forces are stronger. For example, the screenshot shows lots of ripples and waves that form while the cloth is dropping with low damping.
In contrast, with high damping, the cloth drops in a very smooth manner, as the spring corrections are lesser and most of the movement comes from gravity.
